Stop after this song
--------------------

This is a set of appleScript files for iTunes to enable a laking function : just play one song.
An other way to achieve this is to empty or clear the Up Next queue in iTunes.

You will find the sourcefile as well as the ready to use app and script in releases folder.

You can choose to use the app OR to install the script into iTunes.

How to install the script ?
---------------------------

Please follow Doug's great tutorial here : https://dougscripts.com/itunes/itinfo/asitbasics.php

How to use the App ?
----------

Just download the .app folder, copy it to /Applications folder and double-clic to start iTunes (the script will be executed every N seconds to ensure that only 1 and only 1 song is played and then the player stops).
